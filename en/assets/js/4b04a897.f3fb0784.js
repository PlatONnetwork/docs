From this we introduce the cancellation proposal, which is initiated by the validator. The voting cycle can be determined by itself, but it must be within the voting cycle of the cancelled proposal. By initiating the cancellation proposal and the quick response of each node, the software upgrade proposal that is being voted on can be cancelled in a short time, thereby implementing the emergency plan quickly.
