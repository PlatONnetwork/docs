id="public-blockchain-design-principles"></a>Public Blockchain design principles<a class="hash-link" href="#public-blockchain-design-principles" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>One of the core problems of economics research is the rational allocation of scarce resources. The public blockchain is an open, free, and distributed system that everyone can participate in. A well-designed economic model can ensure the reasonable allocation of public blockchain resources on the premise of maximizing the interests of participants, and at the same time align the interests of each participant with the overall interests of the public blockchain, so that it can pursue its own economic interests while also can contribute to the entire blockchain network and ensure that the network can develop steadily for a long time.</p><p>Specifically, the economic design of the public blockchain needs to consider the following issues:</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="distributed-economy-and-infrastructure-payment-problem"></a>Distributed economy and infrastructure payment problem<a class="hash-link" href="#distributed-economy-and-infrastructure-payment-problem" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The core of a distributed economy is the production and distribution of scarce resources, and the allocation of scarce resources is carried out through market mechanisms rather than centralized methods. The distributed economy is autonomous by the community, and the infrastructure of economic activities is jointly built and shared by the community.</p><p>In a distributed economy related to the public blockchain, the most important infrastructure is a distributed ledger (which can be called a distributed trust infrastructure). Miner is a core member of the distributed economy, maintaining distributed ledgers, and needs to bear certain costs and risks. PoW miners need to bear high hardware investment and electricity costs. PoS miners need to lock a certain number of tokens and bear the liquidity cost of the token and the cost of wallet security risks.</p><p>To motivate miners to maintain distributed ledgers, they must compensate for the costs and risks they bear. The issue of incentives for miners is essentially how to pay for infrastructure. The common practice is &quot;who uses who pays&quot;, and this solution faces the following three problems:</p><p>First, this type of income depends on the activeness of transactions within the public blockchain, which is unstable and difficult to predict accurately for miners.</p><p>Second, is this type of revenue sufficient to cover the costs and risks borne by miners? This has plagued the Bitcoin community for quite some time.</p><p>Third, the issue of fairness. Many long-term holders of tokens rarely initiate transactions within the public chain, and therefore rarely pay fees to miners. But the value of their token holdings still depends on the distributed ledger security provided by the miners.</p><p>Block rewards help alleviate these three problems faced by &quot;who uses and pays,&quot; especially in the early stages of public blockchain development.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="token-value-block-rewards-and-inflation-tax"></a>Token value, block rewards and inflation tax<a class="hash-link" href="#token-value-block-rewards-and-inflation-tax" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>There is a key difference between block rewards and &quot;who uses who pays.&quot; &quot;Who uses who pays&quot; is the redistribution of the issued token between the transaction initiator and the miner, and the block reward is the newly issued token obtained by the miner.</p><p>The core issue in the economics of block rewards is the relationship between Token issuance and Token value.</p><p>Token value is affected by fundamentals and liquidity factors. In the long run, the value of Token is mainly determined by the fundamentals. In the short term, liquidity factors have a strong driving force for token value. Assuming that there are no significant changes in the fundamentals and liquidity factors, the newly issued Token will dilute the value of the original Token, and the dilution of the original Token value by the Token issuance can be called inflation tax.</p><p>Compared with &quot;who uses who pays&quot;, inflation tax is a more stable source of income for miners, and those who hold tokens for a long time also pay miners by sharing inflation tax. If the group of miners is regarded as a new token holder, the Token Offering is essentially a transfer of wealth from the original token holder to the new token holder. Therefore, in the short term, the issuance of tokens is mainly a redistribution of wealth; in the long term, the interests of new and old token holders are tied to the rise in the value of the token.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="trust-basis-consensus-algorithm-and-consensus-cost"></a>Trust basis, consensus algorithm and consensus cost<a class="hash-link" href="#trust-basis-consensus-algorithm-and-consensus-cost" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The core of the public blockchain is the consensus algorithm, which has two key points:</p><p>First, additional tokens are issued;</p><p>The second is the distribution of accounting rights in the distributed ledger.</p><p>If the token issuance is mainly to reward the contribution of miners to maintain distributed ledgers, then the allocation of accounting rights is mainly to prevent malicious miners from damaging the distributed ledgers. We give an economic analysis framework for consensus algorithms from the perspective of trust.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="powtechnology-based-trust"></a>PoW—Technology-based trust<a class="hash-link" href="#powtechnology-based-trust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>In PoW, miners do not need to hold tokens to participate in the consensus algorithm. PoW mining is completely random. The greater the computing power controlled by the miner, the greater the probability of obtaining accounting rights.</p><p>In PoW, there is a competitive relationship between miners, and there is no interactive communication and collaboration. Whoever finds the random number Nonce first will get the right of bookkeeping and block reward, while other miners&#x27; previous work is basically void.</p><p>The openness of mining and the competitive relationship between miners make mining costs rise when the price of Token rises. Once a miner invests in computing power, while increasing his own mining success probability, it also reduces the mining success probability of other miners. Therefore, the investment of one miner in computing power will have a negative externality to other miners. As a result, miners entered an &quot;arms race&quot;.</p><p>In general, PoW reflects technology-based trust. It mainly relies on technology to create an environment that does not depend on the identity or credit of miners outside the chain. Miners are in a competitive relationship, but it is difficult to endogenously suppress computing power. Contest raises the cost of mining.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="posinstitution-based-trust"></a>PoS—Institution-based trust<a class="hash-link" href="#posinstitution-based-trust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>In PoS, miners need to hold tokens to participate in consensus algorithms, so there is risk exposure to PoS-type public blockchains, but the hardware facilities they face are much lower than PoW. The size of the risk exposure depends on whether the miner needs to lock the token.</p><p>Locking a token is to temporarily give up the right to sell tokens based on market conditions, that is, to temporarily give up token liquidity. The cost of abandoning token liquidity is positively related to the number and time of locked tokens, and more related to the strategy of holding tokens.</p><p>PoS miners have two significant features. First, the miner&#x27;s off-chain identity and credit are important, and miners need to &quot;cancel votes&quot; from their supporters. The miners&#x27; past performance, such as the rate of block production and the generosity of reward sharing, will directly affect their credit and “get votes”. The evil miners were elected in the election. Second, there is a certain cooperative relationship between different miners. Miners can produce blocks in a sequential or VRF manner, but eventually all miners run a Byzantine agreement on candidate blocks until a consensus is reached.</p><p>In general, PoS reflects trust in the system. Institutions are rules of conduct introduced for group members in order to improve the efficiency of group cooperation. The off-chain identity and credit of miners, the miner election process, and the cooperative relationship between miners in block production and reaching consensus are all examples of the system.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="consensus-cost"></a>Consensus cost<a class="hash-link" href="#consensus-cost" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Regardless of PoW or PoS, the goal of the consensus algorithm is in distributed networks with various errors, malicious attacks, and asynchronous, and without central coordination, to ensure that the distributed ledger will &quot;Eventual consistency&quot;.There is no doubt that there is a cost to reaching this state of consensus, which we call &quot;<strong>consensus cost</strong>&quot;.</p><p>In PoW, the consensus cost is mainly reflected in the mining cost, that is, the investment in mining hardware facilities and the energy consumed by running these hardware facilities, which can be called &quot;technical costs&quot;. It is difficult for PoW to endogenously suppress the increase in technological costs caused by the &quot;arms race&quot;.</p><p>In PoS, although the various systems in PoS can improve the efficiency of group cooperation, the continuous, effective and stable operation of the system is not easy. PoS relies on off-chain identity and credit mechanisms and procedural arrangements for group interaction. The design of these mechanisms has a complex impact on the consensus cost of PoS and can be called &quot;institutional costs.&quot;</p><p>Each consensus algorithm relies on technology-based trust and institution-based trust to varying degrees, and therefore incurs technical and institutional costs, respectively. Consensus cost is the sum of technical and institutional costs. The greater the dependence on technology-based trust, the higher the cost of technology, and vice versa. This relationship is also true of institutional-based trust and institutional costs. Relying entirely on technology-based trust, or relying entirely on system-based trust, will result in relatively high consensus costs. We believe that <strong>there is an optimal ratio between the two trust bases that minimizes the cost of consensus</strong> (Figure 1).</p><img src="/docs/img/en/PlatON_economic_plan.assets/consensus_cost.png" alt="consensus cost"><center>Figure 1 Consensus cost</center><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="platons-economic-design-goals"></a>PlatON&#x27;s economic design goals<a class="hash-link" href="#platons-economic-design-goals" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Based on the previous analysis, PlatON&#x27;s economic design has the following goals:</p><p>First, choose PoS.

This additional period is not a natural time cycle in PlatON, but a block height cycle. Based on 365.25 days a year, it is based on the average block production time within a period of time (the time range is based on the current block). The previous year, calculate the number of blocks in the current additional period. In order to make the additional issue logic always be processed in the settlement block, the additional issue period is designed to be a multiple of the settlement period when designing, so the additional issue block is also a settlement block. Due to the uncertainty of the average block production time, the number of settlement cycles in the issuance cycle will be dynamically adjusted.</p></li><li><p>Epoch</p><p>In PlatON, considering the system processing performance, the logics such as lock-up processing, pledge lock, staking reward issuance, additional issuance, and node ranking are processed periodically and centrally. This cycle is called the Epoch. The last block of the Epoch is called the settlement block, which handles various periodic processing logic in a unified manner. The Epoch is a multiple of the consensus cycle and is fixed at 10750 blocks.</p></li><li><p>Round</p><p>Each consensus Round produces 430 blocks, of which the 410th block is an election block, used to select 43 validator nodes for the next consensus Round.</p></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="published-by-lat"></a>Published by LAT<a class="hash-link" href="#published-by-lat" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The token in the PlatON public blockchain is called LAT. LAT does not have a hard cap, and is divided into initial issuance and additional issuance.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="initial-release"></a>Initial release<a class="hash-link" href="#initial-release" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>LAT&#x27;s initial issuance is distributed to the Founding Team, LatticeX Foundation, Research Fund, Ecosystem Fund, Developer Fund, Private Round and Reserve in a certain proportion. This is achieved by writing the allocated account and balance parameter information into the genesis block configuration, and introduce the corresponding locking mechanism.</p><img src="/docs/img/en/PlatON_economic_plan.assets/Initial distribution.svg" alt="Initial distribution"><p>The initial issuance of locks is controlled through the Lockup contract, and the lock-up and unlocking are performed according to the set Lockup period. The amount of the Locked up Tokens	 cannot be unlocked in advance. In order to improve the processing performance of the system, the locking period must be a multiple of the Epoch (10750blocks). Therefore, the unlocking point (unlocking block height) of each locking period is the Epoch block (the last block of the Epoch).</p><p>In order to protect the equity of the locked-up account, the Locked-up balance can be used to verify the pledge and delegate of the node. When the pledge or delegate is released, the pledged and delegate LAT returns to the Lockup contract.</p><p>According to the Lockup plan, when the unlocked block is reached, the Lockup contract automatically unlocks the corresponding LAT to the locked-up account address.</p><p>Assume that the account A&#x27;s Lockup plan is (a total of 1000LAT):</p><ul><li><p>Locked for 1 Epoch, locked quantity: 100LAT</p></li><li><p>Locked for 2 Epoch, locked quantity: 300LAT</p></li><li><p>Locked for 3 Epoch, locked quantity: 600LAT</p></li></ul><p>The unlocking process flow is shown in the following figure:</p><img src="/docs/img/en/PlatON_economic_plan.assets/unlock_the_restricting_normally.png" alt="unlock_the_restricting_normally"><p>Due to the existence of the locked LAT for pledge or delegate, and the pledge or delegate was returned without expiry, the unlocked block was reached. The account balance in the Lockup  contract was not enough to unlock the amount. At this time, the processing method is to fully unlock and record A &quot;number of accounts owed&quot;, and check whether there is &quot;number of accounts owed&quot; in each settlement block, and whether the locked balance of the account in the Lockup contract is recorded, and if necessary, continue to unlock until the &quot;account owed&quot; returns zero.</p><p>At the same time, it should be pointed out that when Locked-up balance is used to verify the node pledge, and the LAT pledged is reduced by penalties, the system will feed back the Lockup contract, and deduct the corresponding amount of &quot;locked to be unlocked&quot;.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="lat-issue"></a>LAT issue<a class="hash-link" href="#lat-issue" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The additional issue is mainly to motivate miners to maintain distributed ledgers. In the case that pure transaction fees cannot be met as incentives for miners, the additional block issuance will compensate them for the costs and risks. At the same time, the continuous issuance can dilute the holder&#x27;s Token, thereby promoting more people to participate in PoS consensus validator and ensuring a more stable network.</p><p>There are usually two ways to issue additional shares:</p><ul><li>Batch issuance: Periodically issue additional batches, each batch issuing a certain percentage. Such as Cosmos issue method.</li><li>Continuous issuance: irregular issuance can be understood as shortening the batch of batch issuance mode to a very small value. Such as the EOS issue.</li></ul><p>PlatON adopts the batch issuance mode, that is, one issuance per year (one additional period). Compared to continuous issuance, batch issuance is simpler and more practical, and can improve the performance of the chain.</p><p>According to the annual expected number of blocks for the additional period, LAT issuance. <strong>Compared to LAT&#x27;s total issuance at the end of the previous year</strong>, <strong>a fixed additional 2.5% issuance per year</strong>. Additional issuances are made in the additional issuance block (the last block in the last additional period), and 2% of the additional issuance is transferred to the reward pool controlled by smart contracts. And the reward is given to the validator	 by the running of the PPoS consensus algorithm. The remaining 0.5% is transferred to a trust fund, which is used by the LatticeX Foundation as a trustee to reward future developers of the PlatON basic agreement.</p><img src="/docs/img/en/PlatON_economic_plan.assets/additional_period.png" alt="additional_period"><p>Therefore, the current additional period	 of LAT can be expressed as:</p><p>$$f(x)=W\times(1+a \% )^{x-1}\times a \% $$</p><p>among them:</p><p>$x$: The number of the current additional period is from the genesis block to the current number of additional periods (the genesis block begin from first year, the additional period is 1).</p><p>$W$: The total amount of LAT in the initial issuance and circulation is the base of the additional issue in the first year of the genesis block.</p><p>$a%$ : The issuance ratio is fixed at a fixed issuance period.</p><p>The additional LAT issued by the reward pool will be used for validator block rewards and staking rewards.

Any LAT holder can pledge to participate in the validator (alternative validator candidate	), other LAT holders continue to vote through delegation, thereby maintaining a small-scale dynamic alternative validator candidate (alternative node) list, and then in this candidate list, several validators are randomly selected for block generation and validator through VRF and probability distribution. The characteristics of VRF ensure the randomness of the selection, thereby reducing the probability of attacking the validator, and increasing the degree of decentralization. The probability distribution can make the candidate nodes with high equity be selected with a higher probability, thereby motivating the candidate nodes to find ways to increase their equity. As the number of LAT pledged by the entire system increases, the security of the entire system will be higher. In this way, the selection range of validators is narrowed, thereby ensuring consensus efficiency and effectively avoiding the problem of too centralization.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="role-description"></a>Role description<a class="hash-link" href="#role-description" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li><p>Alternative Validator Candidate	</p><p>LAT holders who want to participate in the production of the PlatON block, pledge to lock a certain number of LAT into the staking contract and become alternative validator candidate	.</p></li><li><p>Alternative Validator</p><p>Ranking (see <a href="#alternative-validator-selection">Alternative Validator selection</a> for the ranking rules) Alternative Validator Candidates in the top 201 are called Alternative Validator.
