『*We shall always keep to the upper road and practice justice with prudence in every way.*』 —— Plato

Welcome to the PlatON documentation library. This document is designed to help different users understand PlatON from different perspectives and use PlatON.

## What is PlatON?
PlatON was initiated and promoted by the LatticeX Foundation. Based on the basic properties of the blockchain and supported by a privacy-preserving computing network, PlatON provides the next-generation Internet basic protocol featuring "computing interoperability". It builds a computing system jointly assembled by cryptographic algorithms such as verifiable computing, secure multi-party computing, zero-knowledge proof, homomorphic encryption, and blockchain technology to provide public infrastructure under an open-source architecture for global artificial intelligence, distributed application developers, data providers as well as various institutions, communities and individuals with computing needs.

## Basics

- Blockchain Browser
  - [PlatScan](https://scan.platon.network/)
  - [PlatEye](/docs/en/PlatEye)
- [Network Description](/docs/en/Network_Description)-Here you can learn what networks we have and the differences between them.

## Advanced 

- [Architecture](/docs/en/PlatON_Overall_Solution) - Here you can learn about the overall architecture design of PlatON as a privacy computing infrastructure, and the introduction of related core modules.
- [Economic Model](/docs/en/Economic_Model) - Here you can learn about PlatON economic model design principles and specific economic model solutions.
- [Governance Mechanism](/docs/en/PlatON_Governance_Solution) - Here you can learn how to launch a proposal on PlatON, and the voting mechanism of the proposal.
- [Consensus Mechanism](/docs/en/PlatON_Solution)-Detailed introduction to PlatON consensus mechanism
- [WebAssembly](/docs/en/Wasm_Operation_Principle) - Introduces why PlatON introduced the WASM virtual machine, its mechanism, advantages and how to use it.
