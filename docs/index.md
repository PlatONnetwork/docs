『*We shall always keep to the upper road and practice justice with prudence in every way.*』 —— Plato

Welcome to the PlatON documentation library. This document is designed to help different users understand PlatON from different perspectives and use PlatON.

## What is PlatON?
PlatON was initiated and promoted by the LatticeX Foundation. Based on the basic properties of the blockchain and supported by a privacy-preserving computing network, PlatON provides the next-generation Internet basic protocol featuring "computing interoperability". It builds a computing system jointly assembled by cryptographic algorithms such as verifiable computing, secure multi-party computing, zero-knowledge proof, homomorphic encryption, and blockchain technology to provide public infrastructure under an open-source architecture for global artificial intelligence, distributed application developers, data providers as well as various institutions, communities and individuals with computing needs.
