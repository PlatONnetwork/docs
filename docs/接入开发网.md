This article will describe how to debug local applications by connecting to the PlatON DevNet(development Network).

## How to access the dev network to debug local applications?

### **Step 1: Connect to the DevNet via RPC address**

```
http://47.241.98.219:6789 and ws://47.241.98.219:6790
```
#### Access method 1:  Connect to the DevNet via the local PlatON node
on the ubuntu 18.04 server, download and install the PlatON binary with the following command:
```bash
sudo wget https://download.platon.network/platon/platon/1.0.0/platon -P /usr/bin    
```
Connect to the development network by.
```bash
platon attach http://47.241.98.219:6789
```

#### Access method 2: Connect to the PlatON DevNet through the SDKs

- Use the [Java SDK](/docs/en/Java_SDK) to connect to the DevNet, for example, as follows.
```java
Web3j platonWeb3j = Web3j.build(new HttpService("http://47.241.98.219:6789"));
```
- Use [Python SDK](/docs/en/Python_SDK) to access the DevNet, the example is as follows.
```python
w3 = Web3(HTTPProvider("http://47.241.98.219:6789"))
```
- Use [JS SDK](/docs/en/JS_SDK) to access the DevNet, the example is as follows.
```js
var Web3 = require('web3');
var web3 = new Web3('http://47.241.98.219:6789');
```
- Using [JSON RPC](/docs/en/Json_Rpc) to access the DevNet, the example is as follows.
```curl
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "web3_clientVersion", "params":[], "id":67}' 47.241.98.219:6789
```

Not limited to the above language SDKs, you also have access through SDKs in other languages.

### **Step 2: Apply for DevNet Test Token**

Click [faucet](https://faucet.platon.network/faucet/?id=39fa041c887f11eba4f000163e06ae15) to receive the Test Token. If you have a large Test Token request, please send an email to support@latticex.foundation using the following format.
```
 Title: PlatON Development Network Token Request
 Your Name:
 Contact information：
 Wechart ID (or other instant messaging software)：
 Amount：
 Use：
 Receiving addressA:
 Remarks:
```

After successfully accessing the DevNet, you can send transactions after completing the test Token collection to start your test journey and can check the transactions in [DevNet Browser](https://devnetscan.platon.network).
