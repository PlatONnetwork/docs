Samurai is an open source browser plug-in wallet tool that supports the Alaya and PlatON networks, supporting wallet creation, sending and receiving ATP and LAT, and allowing web DApps to interact with the Alaya and PlatON networks.

Samurai only generates wallet keys on your device, so only you can access your wallet account and data. You therefore need to keep your wallet key (private key, mnemonic) and wallet password safe. Samurai currently only supports Chrome.



## Note

Samurai is a browser plug-in wallet modified based on MetaMask's open source code version 8.0.10, which is mainly adapted to the Alaya network and PlatON network. Due to some bugs in the official MetaMask itself. Please pay attention when using Samurai:

* **Do not click the edit button to edit transaction related information on the transaction confirmation page**.
* **On the transaction confirmation page, please make sure that the receiving address is correct before clicking the confirm button**.
