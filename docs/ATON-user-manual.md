<br />ATON officially supports the WalletConnect standard [observation of wallets and cold wallets are not currently supported]. Not only can you realize the interaction between mobile DApps and ATON, you can also use ATON scan codes to authorize any desktop DApps that support this standard, and you don’t need to worry about asset security. The connection method is also very simple:
<br />1. The desktop DApp chooses to use WalletConnect to connect;
<br />2. Click [Scan] in the upper right corner of the ATON homepage, and select the wallet to complete the authorization;
<br />3. To confirm the operation, perform [Confirm] in ATON;
<br />
